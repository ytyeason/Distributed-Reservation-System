# Distributed-Reservation-System


## The general design and architecture of the system implemented:

* In milestone 1, we implemented RMI and TCP. For milestone 2 and 3, we used RMI architecture and there are few important entities: resource manager, transaction manager, lock manager, and middleware. Milestone 3 is basically based on milestone 2 and we add the data shadow for logging and recovery and 2pc to solve the consensus problem.

* Details can be found in 'Project report.pdf'
